# Eagle Wallpaper

This is a eagle wallpaper that i created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). First i made the lineart using the [sketch](https://github.com/Zourethe/Eagle_Wallpaper/blob/master/sketch.jpg) as a base, after that, i made a copy of the lines and use the Objects to Paths tool ( Shift + Ctrl + C ) and made a Union of it (Ctrl + +). After that, i used the Difference tool (Ctrl + -), selecting the lineart and the background. Finally i use the Split Path tool to separe the parts.

With the parts separed i simply change they colors.
